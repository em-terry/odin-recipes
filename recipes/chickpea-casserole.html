        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This recipe by Caitlin Shoemaker, author of <a href="https://www.frommybowl.com">From My Bowl</a>, is both delicious and easy to make. Filled with healthy plant-based ingredients, this dump-and-bake creamy chickpea casserole whips up in about an hour and is incredibly satisfying. A meal that even the most skeptic of meat-eaters will love!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Creamy Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup raw cashews, soaked in water overnight</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups filtered water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegan chicken-flavored bouillon (or sub 3 1/2 cups veg broth)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Casserole:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces uncooked pasta</li>
            <li>1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1/2 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 ribs celery, sliced</li>
            <li>2/3 cup carrot, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>2/3 cup frozen peas; no need to thaw</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prep:</b> preheat the oven to 425F and set a 9×13″ casserole pan aside.</li>
            <li><b>Blend:</b> add the soaked and drained cashews, water, bouillon, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper to a high-speed blender. Blend on high for 45-60 seconds, until the cashews completely dissolve and you are left with a smooth and creamy sauce.</li>
            <li><b>Mix:</b> add the pasta, chickpeas, onion, celery, carrot, and peas to the casserole dish and mix until evenly distributed. Pour the sauce over the casserole, then use a spatula or spoon to press everything down evenly into the sauce, especially the pasta noodles.</li>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil (or parchment paper, followed by aluminum foil) and bake in the middle rack of the oven for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before uncovering. You may notice that the pasta is cooked, but a few noodles on top are not covered in sauce; because of this, I like to stir the casserole before serving, to evenly distribute the sauce.</li>
            <li><b>Serve</b> warm; leftovers can be stored in the fridge and are best eaten within 5 days.</li><br>
